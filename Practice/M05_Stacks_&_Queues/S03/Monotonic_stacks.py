Monotonic of stacks:
Arranging of elements in a particular either in increasing or decreasing
2 ways
1. Monotomic of Increase order--> small to large
2. Monotomic of Decrease order--> large to small
'''
# 1. Monotomic of Increase order--> small to large
'''Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty stack
2. Itererate every element
3. for every element:
    -->stack should not empty and top element shopuld be greater than your curr elem
         --> Remove the element
4. insert the curr element
5. In the output it will be monotonic of increasing order elements

#Where We apply Monotonic of stacks:
#1. To Find the next greater Element
#2. To Find the next smaller Element
#3. To Find the previous greater element
#4. To Find the Previous smaller Element

#1. To Find the next greater Element:
#Algorithm:
'''1. Find the len of arr
2. create an result array with -1 values
3. iterate through each element throught the next right elements
4. check with the condition (if arr[j] > arr[i])
5. Store the arr[j] value in result
6. after iteration return result array'''
